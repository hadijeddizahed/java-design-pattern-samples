# Bridge Design Pattern

This is just simple example for bridge pattern! 

  # What is bridge pattern? 
  
    Bridge design pattern is used to decouple a class into two parts – abstraction and it’s implementation. 
    Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or huge class into separate class 
    hierarchies that can be developed independently.
  # When to use bridge pattern? 
  
    1- when dealing with cross-platform apps.
    2- supporting multiple types of database servers.
    3- working with several API providers.
  # Our case study

     related to mobile operators.(online chargeing mobile, internet pakeages)
     To develop the project we used multiple mobile services provider (MCI, Irancell, Rightel) that's why I decide to use bridge design
